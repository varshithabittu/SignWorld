# SignWorld
Did you ever come across people with speech impairment?  Wondered how they communicate if they canâ€™t speak or hear? Our project aims to create a  computer application and train  a model which when shown a  real time video of hand gestures  of American Sign Language  shows the output for that  particular sign in text format on  the screen.
